# Notice how there is an extra complile and upload step.
# This is due to how the build-main job checks for errors. Instead of using a script,
# such as, /gradlew build, with this being a datapack, it checks the source files instead. (see Check commands and Check JSON.)
# This is completely intentional, please do not create a PR changing it!
