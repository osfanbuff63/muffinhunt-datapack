Instructions
------------

If you are submitting a new feature, please follow the following steps:

1.  Fill out the template in full.
      This includes providing screenshots and a link to the original feature 
      request. If there isn't an existing feature request, we strongly
      recommend opening a new feature request BEFORE opening your PR to
      implement it, as this allows us to review whether we're likely to accept
      your feature in advance, and also allows us to discuss possible
      implementations for the feature. If there is no associated feature
      request, your PR may be delayed or rejected without warning.
      
      You can open a new feature request by following this link:
      https://github.com/osfanbuff63/muffinhunt-datapack/issues/new/choose

2.  If you are fixing a performance issue, please use the "Bug fix" PR template
      instead. The "bug fix" template is better suited to performance issues.

3.  Include a demonstration.
      If you are adding commands, please provide screenshots and/or a video
      demonstration of the feature. Similarly, if you are adding a new API,
      please include a link to example code that takes advantage of your
      proposed API. This will aid us in reviewing PRs and speed up the process
      significantly.
