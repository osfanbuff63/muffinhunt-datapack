Instructions
------------
If you are submitting a bug fix, please follow the following steps:
1.  Fill out the template in full.
      This includes providing screenshots and a link to the original bug 
      report. If there isn't an existing bug report, we recommend opening a new
      detailed bug report BEFORE opening your PR to fix it, else your PR may be
      delayed or rejected without warning.
      
      You can open a new bug report by following this link:

2.  When linking logs or config files, do not attach them to the post!
      Copy and paste any logs into https://gist.github.com/, then paste a
      link to them in the relevant parts of the template. Do not use Hastebin
      or Pastebin, as this can cause issues with future reviews.
      
      DO NOT drag logs directly into this text box, as we cannot read these!
3.  If you are fixing a performance issue, please include a link to a
    Timings and/or profiler report, both before and after your PR.
4.  If you are fixing a visual bug, such as in commands, please include
