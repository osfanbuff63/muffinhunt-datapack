# What is a MuffinHunt?

## General overview of the series
MuffinHunt is a variation of a certain YouTuber's series, Speedrunner VS Hunter(s). However, MuffinHunt has many changes and tweaks from the remarkably simple Speedrunner VS Hunter.
In a MuffinHunt, the Dragon Ender (formerly known as Speedrunner) is attempting to beat the Ender Dragon (its namesake) before the Juggernaut (formerly known as Hunter) can defeat them.

### Dragon Ender info
The Dragon Ender is trying to get as many resources as they can in a short span of time. They start with a Chainmail Chestplate, a netherite pickaxe, and a shield. (And of course food. :P)
Their goal is to defeat the Ender Dragon before the Juggernaut can kill them.

### Juggernaut info
The Juggernaut's primary goal is to defeat the Dragon Ender. Their gear upgrades automatically over time. One of the best strategies to use as a Juggernaut is to try to sabotage the Dragon Ender as much as possible.

## More specific details
Once the Dragon Ender leaves the Overworld for the Nether, everyone is given their Nether upgrades. The Dragon Ender must locate both a Blaze spawner and Enderman spawner.
These are placed before the MuffinHunt begins. Both the Juggernaut and Dragon Ender can use this.

When the Dragon Ender has had enough of the firey Nether, they can come back to the Overworld and will arrive on the surface. Located here are some villagers, trading for 
bows and arrows. 

If the Dragon Ender survives this long, they can find their way back down to the end portal, where they will enter the End.

The End is arguably the most chaotic part of this. As the Dragon Ender attempts to destroy the Ender Dragon, while the Juggernaut is trying to take their last opportunity to destroy them, can be very fun and chaotic.   

## Rules
MuffinHunts have a number of rules, listed here:
- The Dragon Ender must defeat the ender dragon to win
- The Juggernaut must defeat the Dragon Ender to win.
- If the Dragon Ender defeats the ender dragon right after the Juggernaut or any other entity hits them, causing them to die after they “Free The End,” then it counts a tie.
- No making your own nether portals
- No travelling to the outer end. This would be easily patched by setting a worldborder in the end. Cannot automate that completely however.
- If the runner dies after the dragon is below half of its health, even if it seems like a glitch death, then the muffinhunt is over.
- If either the Juggernaut or the Dragon Ender has to go afk, then they must both go in spectator mode and pause.
- Only use spectator mode when someone is afk or you are very lost. It cannot be used in any other way.
- No going up to the surface until its respective phase (after the Nether).
- The Dragon Ender must hit the Juggernaut for the muffinhunt to start.
- No using hitboxes or any other overlay unless absolutely necessary (F3 + <key>)
- No tunnelling in the nether, unless a player tunnels for a very short amount of time
- No breaking blaze/enderman spawners.
- No enchantments allowed unless included with the datapack give/item commands.
- No hitting people or mobs with default stone axes (they are too op) unless the only use is to disable a shield. In that case, wait 3 sec between hits. This has been patched for MuffinHunt Season 2 in datapack version 1.0.0.
- No starting the muffinhunt until everyone is recording and ready.
- No using beds. 
- No using potions.
- No using /invsee unless absolutely needed.
- No using the /trigger spawnpoint command except at the very beginning of a MuffinHunt.
