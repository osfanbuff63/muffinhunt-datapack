# What is a MuffinHunt?

## General overview of the series
MuffinHunt is a variation of a certain YouTuber's series, Speedrunner VS Hunter(s). However, MuffinHunt has many changes and tweaks from the remarkably simple Speedrunner VS Hunter.
In a MuffinHunt, the Dragon Ender (formerly known as Speedrunner) is attempting to beat the Ender Dragon (its namesake) before the Juggernaut (formerly known as Hunter) can defeat them.
