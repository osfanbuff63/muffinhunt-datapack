# How To Use
You can use this by downloading the zip file that is on the main page of the github, from the "Download source code" dropdown. Throw that in your Minecraft worlds folder and you are good to go!
You can trigger the functions included using the /function command. You'll find them under namespaces muffinhunt:, fullmuffinhunt:, and muffinhunt-dev:.

# Found a bug?
If you find a bug, feel free to create an issue or pull request if you kow how to fix it! That's always appriciated around here.

# Dev stuff
If you have more than one hunter, I highly recommend using the set_worldborder_at_runner function instead of the set_worldborder_at_hunter. If you only have one, it doesn't matter.
