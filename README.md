# muffinhunt-datapack
This is the muffinhunt datapack! You'll find features packed for muffinhunts!

# How To Use
You can use this by downloading the zip file that is on the main page of the github, via the Code dropdown. Unzip that file, and then go into the folder inside that. You can rezip the files, but it's not needed unless you are uploading to a server, which you probably are.
Throw that in your Minecraft world (.minecraft/saves/[worldname]/datapacks by default) folder and you are good to go!
You can trigger the functions included using the /function command. You'll find them under namespaces muffinhunt: and muffinhunt-dev:.

# Contributing

# Found a bug?
If you find a bug, feel free to create an issue or pull request if you know how to fix it! That's always appriciated around here.

# Dev stuff
If you have more than one hunter, I highly recommend using the set_worldborder_at_dragon_ender function instead of the set_worldborder_at_juggernaut. 
If you only have one, it doesn't matter.
