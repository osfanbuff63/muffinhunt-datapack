# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is what versions of this datapack are currently supported for security updates. In general, we support the latest two versions (e.g. when v1.6 is the latest update, we'd support v1.6 and v1.5), as well as whatever the latest beta version is, if applicable. With every major update, we will keep the last version in that release cycle as a long term support version.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.7.x   | :white_check_mark: (LTS) |
| 1.6.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.6.0 | :x:                |
